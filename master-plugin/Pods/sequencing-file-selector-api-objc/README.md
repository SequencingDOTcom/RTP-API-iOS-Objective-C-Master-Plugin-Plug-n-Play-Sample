# File Selector CocoPod plugin for adding Squencing.com's Real-Time Personalization technology to iOS apps coded in Objective-C
=========================================
This repo contains the plug-n-play CocoPod for implementing a customizable File Selector so your app can access files stored securely at [Sequencing.com](https://sequencing.com/). 

This CocoPod can be used to quickly add a File Selector to your app. By adding this File Selector to your app, you're app user will be able to select a file stored securely in the user's Sequencing.com account. Your app will then be able to use the genetic data in this file to provide the user with Real-Time Personalization.

While the File Selector works out-of-the-box, it is also fully customizable.

A 'Master CocoPod Plugin' is also available. The Master Plugin contains a customizable, end-to-end solution that quickly adds all necessary code to your app for Sequencing.com's Real-Time Personalization. 

Once the Master Plugin is added to your app all you'll need to do is:

1. add your [OAuth2 secret](https://sequencing.com/developer-center/new-app-oauth-secret)
2. add one or more [App Chain numbers](https://sequencing.com/app-chains/)
3. configure your app based on each [app chain's possible responses](https://sequencing.com/app-chains/)

To code Real-Time Personalization technology into apps, developers may [register for a free account](https://sequencing.com/user/register/) at Sequencing.com. App development with RTP is always free.

Cocoa Pod integration
======================================

Please follow this guide to install File Selector module in your existed or new project.

* Install oAuth module and File Selector modules
	* see general CocoaPods instruction 
		```
		https://cocoapods.org > getting started
		```
		
	* oAuth CocoaPod plugin reference: [Objective-C (CocoaPod plugin)](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/CocoaPod-iOS-OAuth-ObjectiveC)
	
	* File selector module prepared as separate module, but it depends on a Token object from oAuth module. File selector can execute request to server for files with token object only. Thus you need 2 modules to be installed: ```oAuth``` module and ```File Selector``` module 
	
	* create a new project in Xcode
	
	* create Podfile in your project directory: 
		```
		$ pod init
		```
		
	* specify ```sequencing-oauth-api-objc``` pod parameters: 
		```
		$ pod 'sequencing-oauth-api-objc', '~> 1.0.2'
		```
		
	* specify ```sequencing-fileselector-objc``` pod parameters: 
		```
		$ pod 'sequencing-file-selector-api-objc', '~> 1.0.3'
		```
		
	* install the dependency in your project: 
		```
		$ pod install
		```
		
	* always open the Xcode workspace instead of the project file: 
		```
		$ open *.xcworkspace
		```

* Set up OAuth module
	* oAuth CocoaPod plugin reference: [Objective-C (CocoaPod plugin)](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/CocoaPod-iOS-OAuth-ObjectiveC)

* Set up file selector UI
	* add "Storyboard Reference" in your Main.storyboard
		* select added Storyboard Reference
		* open Utilities > Atributes inspector
		* select ```TabbarFileSelector``` in Storyboard dropdown
		
	* add segue from your ViewController to created Storyboard Reference
		* open Utilities > Atributes inspector
		* name this segue as ```GET_FILES``` in Identifier field
		
	* add ```TabbarFileSelector.storyboard``` file into your project Bundle Resources
		* Build Phases > Copy Bundle Resources > add your ```TabbarFileSelector``` storyboard using the icon "+"

* Subscribe for file selector protocol
	* add file selector protocol import in your class were you getting and handling file selector:
		```
		#import "SQFileSelectorProtocol.h"
		```	
		
	* subscribe your class to file selector protocol: 
		```
		<SQFileSelectorProtocol>
		```
		
	* add import: 
		```
		#import "SQFilesAPI.h"
		```
		
	* subscribe your class as handler/delegate for selected file in file selector: 
		```
		[[SQFilesAPI sharedInstance] setFileSelectedHandler:self];
		```
		
	* implement "handleFileSelected" method from protocol
		```
		- (void)handleFileSelected:(NSDictionary *)file {
			// your code here
		}
		```

* Use file selector 
	* set up some button for getting/viewing files for logged in user, and specify delegate method for this button
	* specify UI segue name constant
		```
		static NSString *const FILES_CONTROLLER_SEGUE_ID = @"GET_FILES";
		```	
		
	* you can load/get files, list of my files and list of sample files, via ```withToken: loadFiles:``` method (via ```SQFilesAPI``` class with shared instance init access).
	
		pay attention, you need to pass on the String value of ```token.accessToken``` object as a parameter for this method:
		```
		[[SQFilesAPI sharedInstance] withToken:self.token.accessToken loadFiles:^(BOOL success) {
			// your code here
		}];
		```
		
		```withToken: loadFiles:``` method will return a BOOL value with YES if files were successfully loaded or NO if there were any problem. You need to manage this in your code
		
	* if files were loaded successfully you can open/show File Selector now in UI. You can do it by calling file selector view via ```performSegueWithIdentifier``` method:
		```
		[self performSegueWithIdentifier:FILES_CONTROLLER_SEGUE_ID sender:@0];
		```
		
		note: this code will work only if you already set up the reference to TabbarFileSelector.storyboard in your storyboard
		
	* selected file will already appear as a parameter in ```handleFileSelected:``` method from ```SQFileSelectorProtocol``` protocol. In this method you can handle selected file
	
	* each file is a NSDictionary object with following keys and values:
		```
		DateAdded:     "string value"
		Ext:           "string value"
		FileCategory:  "string value"
		FileSubType:   "string value"
		FileType:      "string value"
		FriendlyDesc1: "string value"
		FriendlyDesc2: "string value"
		Id:            "string value"
		Name:          "string value"
		Population:    "string value"
		Sex:           "string value"
    	```
