# File Selector CocoPod plugin for adding Sequencing.com's Real-Time Personalization technology to iOS apps coded in Objective-C
=========================================
This repo contains the plug-n-play CocoPod for implementing a customizable File Selector so your app can access files stored securely at [Sequencing.com](https://sequencing.com/). 

This CocoPod can be used to quickly add a File Selector to your app. By adding this File Selector to your app, you're app user will be able to select a file stored securely in the user's Sequencing.com account. Your app will then be able to use the genetic data in this file to provide the user with Real-Time Personalization.

While the File Selector works out-of-the-box, it is also fully customizable.

A 'Master CocoPod Plugin' is also available. The Master Plugin contains a customizable, end-to-end solution that quickly adds all necessary code to your app for Sequencing.com's Real-Time Personalization. 

Once the Master Plugin is added to your app all you'll need to do is:

1. add your [OAuth2 secret](https://sequencing.com/developer-center/new-app-oauth-secret)
2. add one or more [App Chain numbers](https://sequencing.com/app-chains/)
3. configure your app based on each [app chain's possible responses](https://sequencing.com/app-chains/)

To code Real-Time Personalization technology into apps, developers may [register for a free account](https://sequencing.com/user/register/) at Sequencing.com. App development with RTP is always free.

Cocoa Pod integration
======================================

Please follow this guide to install File Selector module in your existed or new project.

### Step 1: Install oAuth module and File Selector modules

* see general CocoaPods instruction 
	```
	https://cocoapods.org > getting started
	```
		
* oAuth CocoaPod plugin reference: [Objective-C (CocoaPod plugin)](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/CocoaPod-iOS-OAuth-ObjectiveC)

* File selector module prepared as separate module, but it depends on a Token object from oAuth module. File selector can execute request to server for files with token object only. Thus you need 2 modules to be installed: ```oAuth``` module and ```File Selector``` module 

* create a new project in Xcode
	
* create Podfile in your project directory: 
	```
	$ pod init
	```
		
* specify following parameters in Podfile: 
	```
	pod 'sequencing-oauth-api-objc', '~> 1.0.8'
	pod 'sequencing-file-selector-api-objc', '~> 1.0.12'
	```		
		
* install the dependency in your project: 
	```
	$ pod install
	```
		
* always open the Xcode workspace instead of the project file: 
	```
	$ open *.xcworkspace
	```


### Step 2: Set up OAuth module

* oAuth CocoaPod plugin reference: [Objective-C (CocoaPod plugin)](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/CocoaPod-iOS-OAuth-ObjectiveC)


### Step 3: Set up file selector UI

* add "Storyboard Reference" in your Main.storyboard
	* select added Storyboard Reference
	* open Utilities > Atributes inspector
	* select ```TabbarFileSelector``` in Storyboard dropdown
		
* add segue from your ViewController to created Storyboard Reference
	* open Utilities > Atributes inspector
	* name this segue as ```GET_FILES``` in Identifier field
	* set Kind as ```Modal```
		
* add ```TabbarFileSelector.storyboard``` file into your project Bundle Resources
	* Build Phases > Copy Bundle Resources > add your ```TabbarFileSelector``` storyboard using the icon "+"


### Step 4: Subscribe for file selector protocol

* add file selector protocol import in your class were you getting and handling file selector:
	```
	#import "SQFileSelectorProtocol.h"
	```	
		
* subscribe your class to file selector protocol: 
	```
	<SQFileSelectorProtocol>
	```
		
* add import: 
	```
	#import "SQFilesAPI.h"
	```
		
* subscribe your class as handler/delegate for selected file in file selector: 
	```
	[[SQFilesAPI sharedInstance] setFileSelectedHandler:self];
	```
		
* implement "handleFileSelected" method from protocol
	```
	- (void)handleFileSelected:(NSDictionary *)file {
		// your code here
	}
	```

* implement optional "closeButtonPressed" method from protocol if needed
	```
	- (void)closeButtonPressed {
	    // your code here
	}
	```


### Step 5: Use file selector 

* set up some button for getting/viewing files for logged in user, and specify delegate method for this button
	
* specify segue ID constant
	```
	static NSString *const FILES_CONTROLLER_SEGUE_ID = @"GET_FILES";
	```	
		
* you can load/get files, list of my files and list of sample files, via ```withToken: loadFiles:``` method (via ```SQFilesAPI``` class with shared instance init access).
	
	pay attention, you need to pass on the String value of ```token.accessToken``` object as a parameter for this method:
	```
	[[SQFilesAPI sharedInstance] withToken:self.token.accessToken loadFiles:^(BOOL success) {
		// your code here
	}];
	```
		
	```withToken: loadFiles:``` method will return a BOOL value with YES if files were successfully loaded or NO if there were any problem. You need to manage this in your code
		
* if files were loaded successfully you can open/show File Selector now in UI. You can do it by calling file selector view via ```performSegueWithIdentifier``` method:
	```
	[self performSegueWithIdentifier:FILES_CONTROLLER_SEGUE_ID sender:@0];
	```
	
	while opening File Selector in UI you can set `Close` button to be present if you need
	```
	[SQFilesAPI sharedInstance].closeButton = YES;
	```
	
* when user selects any file and clics on "Continue" button in UI - ```handleFileSelected:``` method from ```SQFileSelectorProtocol``` protocol then.
	Selected file will be passed on as a parameter. In this method you can handle selected file
	
* each file is a NSDictionary object with following keys and values format:
	
	key name | type | description
	------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
	DateAdded | String | date file was added
	Ext | String | file extension
	FileCategory | String | file category: Community, Uploaded, FromApps, Altruist
	FileSubType | String | file subtype
	FileType | String | file type
	FriendlyDesc1 | String | person name for sample files
	FriendlyDesc2 | String | person description for sample files
	Id | String | file ID
	Name | String | file name
	Population | String | 
	Sex | String |	the sex

	// set up select file button
   	UIButton *selectFileButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect];
   	[selectFileButton setTitle:@"Select file" forState:UIControlStateNormal];
   	[selectFileButton addTarget:self action:@selector(getFiles:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
   	[selectFileButton sizeToFit];
   	[selectFileButton setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints:NO];
   	[self.view addSubview:selectFileButton];
   
   	// adding constraints for select file
   	NSLayoutConstraint *xCenter = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:selectFileButton
   															attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX
   															relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual
   															toItem:self.view
   															attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX
   															multiplier:1
   															constant:0];
    															
   	NSLayoutConstraint *yCenter = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:selectFileButton
   															attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterY
   															relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual
   															toItem:self.view
   															attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterY
   															multiplier:1
   															constant:0];
   	[self.view addConstraint:xCenter];
   	[self.view addConstraint:yCenter];
	```
	
* example of ```getFiles``` method via ```performSegueWithIdentifier``` method
	```
	- (void)getFiles:(UIButton *)sender {	
		[[SQFilesAPI sharedInstance] withToken:self.token.accessToken loadFiles:^(BOOL success) {
			dispatch_async(kMainQueue, ^{
				if (success) {
					// redirect user to view with tab bar with related files displayed (with subcategories)
					[self performSegueWithIdentifier:FILES_CONTROLLER_SEGUE_ID sender:@0];
				
				} else {
					[self showAlertWithMessage:@"Can't load files"];
				}
			});
		}];
	}
	```

* example of ```getFiles``` method via direct storyboard opening
	```
	- (void)getFiles:(UIButton *)sender {
		SQFilesAPI *filesAPI = [SQFilesAPI sharedInstance];
        [filesAPI setFileSelectedHandler:self];
        filesAPI.closeButton = YES;	
		[filesAPI withToken:self.token.accessToken loadFiles:^(BOOL success) {
			dispatch_async(kMainQueue, ^{
				if (success) {
					// open file selector view
					UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"TabbarFileSelector" bundle:nil];
					UINavigationController *fileSelectorVC = (UINavigationController *)[storyboard instantiateInitialViewController];
					fileSelectorVC.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleCoverVertical;
					[self presentViewController:fileSelectorVC animated:YES completion:nil];
				
				} else {
					[self showAlertWithMessage:@"Can't load files"];
				}
			});
		}];
