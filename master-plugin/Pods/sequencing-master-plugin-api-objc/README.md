# Master CocoaPod Plugin for adding Sequencing.com's Real-Time Personalization technology to iOS apps coded in Objective-C
=========================================
This Master CocoaPod Plugin can be used to quickly add Real-Time Personalization to your app. This Master Plugin contains a customizable, end-to-end plug-n-play solution that quickly adds all necessary code (OAuth2, File Selector and App Chain coding) to your app.

Once this Master Plugin is added to your app all you'll need to do is:

1. add your [OAuth2 secret](https://sequencing.com/developer-center/new-app-oauth-secret)
2. add one or more [App Chain numbers](https://sequencing.com/app-chains/)
3. configure your app based on each [app chain's possible responses](https://sequencing.com/app-chains/)

To code Real-Time Personalization technology into apps, developers may [register for a free account](https://sequencing.com/user/register/) at Sequencing.com. App development with RTP is always free.

**The Master Plugin is also available in the following languages:**
* Objective-C (CocoaPod plugin) <-- this repo
* [Swift (CocoaPod plugin)](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/CocoaPods-iOS-Master-Plugin-Swift)
* [Android (Maven plugin)](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/Maven-Android-Master-Plugin-Java)
* [Java (Maven plugin)](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/Maven-Android-Master-Plugin-Java)

Implementation
======================================
To implement this Master Plugin for your app:

1) [Register](https://sequencing.com/user/register/) for a free account

2) Add this Master Plugin to your app

3) [Generate an OAuth2 secret](https://sequencing.com/api-secret-generator) and insert the secret into the plugin

4) Add one or more [App Chain numbers](https://sequencing.com/app-chains/). The App Chain will provide genetic-based information you can use to personalize your app.

5) Configure your app based on each [app chain's possible responses](https://sequencing.com/app-chains/)


Master CocoaPod Plugin install
======================================
* see [CocoaPods guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)
* create Podfile in your project directory: ```$ pod init```
* specify "sequencing-master-plugin-api-objc" pod parameters in Podfile: 

	```pod 'sequencing-master-plugin-api-objc', '~> 1.0.6'```

* install the dependency in your project: ```$ pod install```
* always open the Xcode workspace instead of the project file: ```$ open *.xcworkspace```
* as a result you'll have 3 CocoaPod plugins installed: OAuth, Files Selector and AppChains


Authentication flow
======================================
Sequencing.com uses standard OAuth approach which enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service from 3rd party applications without exposing the user's password. OAuth acts as an intermediary on behalf of the end user, providing the service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to be shared.

## Steps

### Step 1: Authorization Code Link

First, the user is given an webpage opened by following authorization code link:

```
https://sequencing.com/oauth2/authorize?redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URL&response_type=code&state=STATE&client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=SCOPES
```

Here is an explanation of the link components:
* ```https://sequencing.com/oauth2/authorize``` - the API authorization endpoint
* ```redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URL``` - where the service redirects the user-agent after an authorization code is granted
* ```response_type=code``` - specifies that your application is requesting an authorization code grant
* ```state=STATE``` - holds the random verification code that will be compared with the same code within the server answer in order to verify if response was being spoofed
* ```client_id=CLIENT_ID``` - the application's client ID (how the API identifies the application)
* ```scope=CODES``` specifies the level of access that the application is requesting

![login dialog](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/oAuth2-code-and-demo/blob/master/screenshots/oauth_auth.png)


### Step 2: User Authorizes Application

User must first log in to the service, to authenticate their identity (unless they are already logged in). Then they will be prompted by the service to authorize or deny the application access to their account. Here is an example authorize application prompt

![grant dialog](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/oAuth2-code-and-demo/blob/master/screenshots/oauth_grant.png)


### Step 3: Application Receives Authorization Code

When user clicks "Authorize Application", the service will open the redirect_URI url address, which was specified during the authorization request. In iOS application following ```redirect_uri``` was used:

```
authapp://Default/Authcallback
```

As soon as your application detects that redirect_uri page was opened then it should analyse the server response with the state verification code. If the state verification code matches the one was sent in authorization request then it means that the server response is valid.
Now we can get the authorization code form the server response.


### Step 4: Application Requests Access Token

The application requests an access token from the API, by passing the authorization code (got from server response above) along with authentication details, including the client secret, to the API token endpoint. Here is an example POST request to Sequencing.com token endpoint:

```
https://sequencing.com/oauth2/token
```

Following POST parameters have to be sent

* grant_type='authorization_code'
* code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE (where AUTHORIZATION_CODE is a code acquired in a "code" parameter in the result of redirect from sequencing.com)
* redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URL (where REDIRECT_URL is the same URL as the one used in step 1)


### Step 5: Application Receives Access Token

If the authorization is valid, the API will send a JSON response containing the token object to the application. Token object contains accessToken, its expirationDate, tokenType, scope and refreshToken.


OAuth CocoaPod Plugin integration
======================================

* **Add Application Transport Security setting**
	* open project settings > Info tab
	* add ```App Transport Security Settings``` row parameter (as Dictionary)
	* add subrow to App Transport Security Settings parameter as ```Exception Domains``` dictionary parameter
	* add subrow to Exception Domains parameter with ```sequencing.com``` string value
	* add subrow to App Transport Security Settings parameter with ```Allow Arbitrary Loads``` boolean value
	* set ```Allow Arbitrary Loads``` boolean value as ```YES```
	
	![sample files](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/CocoaPod-iOS-OAuth-ObjectiveC/blob/master/Screenshots/authTransportSecuritySetting.png)


* **Create View Controllers, e.g. for Login screen and for Start screen**
	
* **In your LoginViewController class:**
	
	* add imports
		```
		#import "SQOAuth.h"
		#import "SQToken.h"
		```
		
	* for authorization you need to specify your application parameters in NSString format (BEFORE using authorization method) 
		```
		static NSString *const CLIENT_ID	 = @"your CLIENT_ID here";
		static NSString *const CLIENT_SECRET = @"your CLIENT_SECRET here";
		static NSString *const REDIRECT_URI	 = @"REDIRECT_URI here";
		static NSString *const SCOPE         = @"SCOPE here";
		```    
			
	* register these parameters into OAuth module instance
		```
		[[SQOAuth sharedInstance] registrateApplicationParametersCliendID:CLIENT_ID 
									ClientSecret:CLIENT_SECRET 
									RedirectUri:REDIRECT_URI 
									Scope:SCOPE];
		```
		
	* add import for protocol
		```
		#import "SQAuthorizationProtocol.h"
		```
			
	* subscribe your class for this protocol
		```
		<SQAuthorizationProtocol>
		```
	
	* subscribe your class as delegate for such protocol
		```
		[[SQOAuth sharedInstance] setAuthorizationDelegate:self];
		```
		
	* add methods for SQAuthorizationProtocol
		```
		- (void)userIsSuccessfullyAuthorized:(SQToken *)token {
			dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
				// your code is here for successful user authorization
			});
		}

		- (void)userIsNotAuthorized {
			dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
				// your code is here for unsuccessful user authorization
			});
		}
		```
		
	* you can authorize your user now (e.g. via "login" button). For authorization you can use ```authorizeUser``` method. You can get access via shared instance of SQOAuth class)
		```
		[[SQOAuth sharedInstance] authorizeUser];
		```
			
		Related method from SQAuthorizationProtocol will be called as a result
		
	* example of Login button (you can use ```@"button_signin_black"``` image that is included into the Pod within ```AuthImages.xcassets```)
		```
		// set up login button
   		UIButton *loginButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];
   		[loginButton setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"button_signin_black"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
   		[loginButton addTarget:self action:@selector(loginButtonPressed) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
   		[loginButton sizeToFit];
   		[loginButton setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints:NO];
   		[self.view addSubview:loginButton];
   
   		// adding constraints for login button
   		NSLayoutConstraint *xCenter = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:loginButton 
   																attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX 
   																relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual 
   																toItem:self.view 
   																attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX 
   																multiplier:1 constant:0];
    															
   		NSLayoutConstraint *yCenter = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:loginButton
   																attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterY
   																relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual
   																toItem:self.view
   																attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterY
   																multiplier:1
   																constant:0];
   		[self.view addConstraint:xCenter];
   		[self.view addConstraint:yCenter];
   		```
    	
   	* example of ```loginButtonPressed``` method 
   		```
   		- (void)loginButtonPressed {
   			[[SQOAuth sharedInstance] authorizeUser];
   		}
   		```   		
		
	* add segue in Storyboard from LoginViewController to MainViewController with identifier ```GOTO_MAIN_SCREEN```
		
	* add constant for segue id
		```static NSString *const GOTO_MAIN_SCREEN_SEGUE_ID = @"GOTO_MAIN_SCREEN";```
		
	* example of navigation methods when user is authorized
		```
		- (void)userIsSuccessfullyAuthorized:(SQToken *)token {
			dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
				[self performSegueWithIdentifier:GOTO_MAIN_SCREEN_SEGUE_ID sender:token];
			});
		}
			
		- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {
			if ([segue.identifier isEqual:GOTO_MAIN_SCREEN_SEGUE_ID]) {
				StartViewController *startVC = segue.destinationViewController;
				[startVC setToken:sender];
			}
		}
		```
		
* **In your StartViewController class:**
		
	* add imports
		```
		#import "SQOAuth.h"
		#import "SQToken.h"
		```
		
	* add import for protocol
		```
		#import "SQTokenRefreshProtocol.h"
		```
		
	* subscribe your class for these protocols
		```
		<SQTokenRefreshProtocol>
		```
		
	* subscribe your class as delegate for such protocols
		```
		[[SQOAuth sharedInstance] setRefreshTokenDelegate:self];
		```
		
	* add method for SQTokenRefreshProtocol - it is called when token is refreshed
		```
		- (void)tokenIsRefreshed:(SQToken *)updatedToken {
			// your code is here to handle refreshed token
		}
		```
		
	* in method ```userIsSuccessfullyAuthorized``` you'll receive SQToken object, that contains following 5 properties with clear titles for usage:
		```	
		NSString *accessToken
		NSDate   *expirationDate
		NSString *tokenType
		NSString *scope
		NSString *refreshToken
		```
	
	* in method ```tokenIsRefreshed``` you'll receive updated token with the same object model.
	
		DO NOT OVERRIDE ```refresh_token``` property for ```token``` object - it comes as ```nil``` after refresh token request
	
	* for your extra needs you can always get access directly to the up-to-day token object which is stored in ```SQAuthResult``` class via ```token``` property
		```
		[[SQAuthResult sharedInstance] token];
		```


File Selector CocoaPod Plugin integration
======================================

* **Set up file selector UI**

	* add "Storyboard Reference" in your Main.storyboard
		* select added Storyboard Reference
		* open Utilities > Atributes inspector
		* select ```TabbarFileSelector``` in Storyboard dropdown
		
	* add segue from your ViewController to created Storyboard Reference
		* open Utilities > Atributes inspector
		* name this segue as ```GET_FILES``` in Identifier field
		* set Kind as ```Modal```
		
	* add ```TabbarFileSelector.storyboard``` file into your project Bundle Resources
		* Build Phases > Copy Bundle Resources > add your ```TabbarFileSelector``` storyboard using the icon "+"

* **Subscribe for file selector protocol**

	* add file selector protocol import in your class (e.g. StartViewController class) were you getting and handling file selector:
		```
		#import "SQFileSelectorProtocol.h"
		```	
		
	* subscribe your class to file selector protocol: 
		```
		<SQFileSelectorProtocol>
		```
		
	* add import: 
		```
		#import "SQFilesAPI.h"
		```
		
	* subscribe your class as handler/delegate for selected file in file selector: 
		```
		[[SQFilesAPI sharedInstance] setFileSelectedHandler:self];
		```
		
	* implement "handleFileSelected" method from protocol
		```
		- (void)handleFileSelected:(NSDictionary *)file {
			// your code here
		}
		```

* **Use file selector**

	* set up some button for getting/viewing files for logged in user, and specify delegate method for this button
	
	* specify segue ID constant
		```
		static NSString *const FILES_CONTROLLER_SEGUE_ID = @"GET_FILES";
		```	
		
	* you can load/get files, list of my files and list of sample files, via ```withToken: loadFiles:``` method (via ```SQFilesAPI``` class with shared instance init access).
	
		pay attention, you need to pass on the String value of ```token.accessToken``` object as a parameter for this method:
		```
		[[SQFilesAPI sharedInstance] withToken:self.token.accessToken loadFiles:^(BOOL success) {
			// your code here
		}];
		```
		
		```withToken: loadFiles:``` method will return a BOOL value with YES if files were successfully loaded or NO if there were any problem. You need to manage this in your code
		
	* if files were loaded successfully you can open/show File Selector now in UI. You can do it by calling file selector view via ```performSegueWithIdentifier``` method:
		```
		[self performSegueWithIdentifier:FILES_CONTROLLER_SEGUE_ID sender:@0];
		```
	
	* when user selects any file and clics on "Continue" button in UI - ```handleFileSelected:``` method from ```SQFileSelectorProtocol``` protocol then.
		Selected file will be passed on as a parameter. In this method you can handle selected file
	
	* each file is a NSDictionary object with following keys and values format:
	
		key name | type | description
		------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
		DateAdded | String | date file was added
		Ext | String | file extension
		FileCategory | String | file category: Community, Uploaded, FromApps, Altruist
		FileSubType | String | file subtype
		FileType | String | file type
		FriendlyDesc1 | String | person name for sample files
		FriendlyDesc2 | String | person description for sample files
		Id | String | file ID
		Name | String | file name
		Population | String | 
		Sex | String |	the sex

    	[selectFileButton addTarget:self action:@selector(getFiles:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
    	[selectFileButton sizeToFit];
    	[selectFileButton setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints:NO];
    	[self.view addSubview:selectFileButton];
    
    	// adding constraints for select file
    	NSLayoutConstraint *xCenter = [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:selectFileButton
    															attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX
    															relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual
    															toItem:self.view
    															attribute:NSLayoutAttributeCenterX

AppChains CocoaPod Plugin integration
======================================
There are no strict configurations that have to be performed.

Just drop the source files for an app chain into your project to add Real-Time Personalization to your app.

Code snippets below contain the following three placeholders. Please make sure to replace each of the placeholders with real values:
* ```<your token>``` 
 * replace with the oAuth2 secret obtained from your [Sequencing.com account](https://sequencing.com/api-secret-generator)
  * The code snippet for enabling Sequencing.com's oAuth2 authentication for your app can be found in the [oAuth2 code and demo repo](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/oAuth2-code-and-demo)

* ```<chain id>``` 
 * replace with the App Chain ID obtained from the list of [App Chains](https://sequencing.com/app-chains)

* ```<file id>``` 
 * replace with the file ID selected by the user while using your app
  * The code snippet for enabling Sequencing.com's File Selector for your app can be found in the [File Selector code repo](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/File-Selector-code)


AppChains Objective-C API overview

After that you can start utilizing Reporting API

```objectivec
[appChains getReportWithRemoteMethodName:@"StartApp"
               withApplicationMethodName:@"<chain id>"
                        withDatasourceId:@"<file id>"
                        withSuccessBlock:^(Report *result) {
                               NSArray *arr = [result getResults];
                               for (Result *obj in arr) {
                                    ResultValue *frv = [obj getValue];

                                    if ([frv getType] == kResultTypeFile) {
                                        [(FileResultValue *)frv saveToLocation:@"/tmp/"];
                                    }
                                }
                            } withFailureBlock:^(NSError *error) {
                                NSLog(@"Error occured: %@", [error description]);
                            }];
